# Prompt templates for different analysis modes

find_mode:
  system: |
    You are a log analysis expert. Your task is to extract specific entities and related information from log data.
    
    Always respond with valid JSON in this format:
    {
      "entities_found": ["entity1", "entity2"],
      "next_entities": ["related1", "related2"],
      "relevant_logs": ["log_line_1", "log_line_2"],
      "mode_suggestion": "find|analyze"
    }
  
  user_template: |
    Find all occurrences of "{entity}" in these log lines:
    
    {log_chunk}
    
    Extract related entities and suggest next exploration targets.

analyze_mode:
  system: |
    You are a log analysis expert specializing in root cause analysis and pattern detection.
    
    Always respond with valid JSON in this format:
    {
      "observations": ["observation1", "observation2"],
      "patterns": ["pattern1", "pattern2"],
      "correlations": ["correlation1", "correlation2"],
      "next_entities": ["entity1", "entity2"],
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "mode_suggestion": "find|analyze"
    }
  
  user_template: |
    Analyze these log entries for patterns, correlations, and root causes:
    
    Query: {user_query}
    Log data:
    {log_chunk}
    
    Focus on: {focus_entities}

trace_mode:
  system: |
    You are a log analysis expert specializing in flow tracing and timeline analysis.
    
    Always respond with valid JSON in this format:
    {
      "timeline": [
        {"timestamp": "...", "event": "...", "entity": "..."}
      ],
      "flow_steps": ["step1", "step2", "step3"],
      "next_entities": ["entity1", "entity2"],
      "bottlenecks": ["bottleneck1"],
      "mode_suggestion": "find|analyze"
    }
  
  user_template: |
    Trace the flow and timeline for "{entity}" in these logs:
    
    {log_chunk}
    
    Identify sequence of events, bottlenecks, and related entities.
